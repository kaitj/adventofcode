# Advent of Code 2021

My solutions to the exercises at https://adventofcode.com/2021, completed in Python (3.10).

## Notes
* Solutions will primarily rely on user input instead of hard-coded paths
* Attempt at minimizing time complexity of code
* Implements unit testing

## Code
To run the code for any particular day from the directory of the day:

```
python <day>.py
```

After running, user should be prompted for input (or usage will be printed)
