# Advent of Code 2023

My solutions to the exercises at https://adventofcode.com/2023, completed in
Python.

## Notes

## Code

To setup the directory structure for a given day:

```bash

setup_day.sh <day>
```

To run the code for any particular day from the directory of the day:

```bash
poetry run python <day>/<day>.py
```

Inputs should be saved in a file named `input.txt` within the associated
directory for a given day
