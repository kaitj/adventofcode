# Advent of Code 2020

My solutions to the exercises at https://adventofcode.com/2020, completed in Python.

## Notes
* Solutions will primarily rely on user input instead of hard-coded paths
* Attempt at minimizing time complexity of code

## Code
To run the code for any particular day from the parent directory:

```
python <day>/<day>.py
```

After running, user should be prompted for input (or usage will be printed)
